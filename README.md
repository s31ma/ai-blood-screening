# AI-Driven Blood Screening System

## Overview
This project develops an **AI-powered blood screening system** that analyzes patient bloodwork to detect **nutrient deficiencies** and recommends **personalized supplement plans**. Using **machine learning and biomedical analysis**, the system identifies primary deficiencies and suggests **supporting vitamins and minerals** to enhance absorption and effectiveness.

## Features
- **Bloodwork Analysis**: Detects deficiencies in key vitamins and minerals.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests optimal supplementation plans.
- **Absorption Optimization**: Identifies supporting nutrients for better bioavailability.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses AI models trained on biomedical datasets for accurate predictions.
- **Scalable and Adaptable**: Can be expanded to include new biomarkers and datasets.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow / PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **API Deployment**: FastAPI / Flask
